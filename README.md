# Centre for Advanced Machine Learning and Applications (CAMLAs)
I have worked in this lab seasonally since 2021 as a Research Assistant. I am so much fortunate to be a part of this super-talented and wonderful team.
Our research focuses on developing computer vision, image processing, and bioinformatics models
- As a Software Engineer, I have been tasked with showcasing our visions and research works. I tried to build this website with basic frontend technology (HTML5, CSS3 and Js). Further better and more dynamic version of this lab website is under construction.
